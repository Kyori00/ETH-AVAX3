# ETH-AVAX3
## Description
For this project, I have created a simple Mint, Transfer, and Burn mechanism with a little minigame called coinflip to which the owner can mint a random amount of coin.
### Executing the program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website.
You can download the sol file and import it on remix.
